## Database Design


A couple recommendations for building free ERDs:
- [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/ER-diagram-symbols-and-meaning)

I have used `pygraphviz` and `django-extensions` to auto-generate an ERD.

The steps taken were as follows:
- In the terminal: `sudo apt update`
- then: `sudo apt-get install python3-dev graphviz libgraphviz-dev pkg-config`
- then type `Y` to proceed
- then: `pip3 install django-extensions pygraphviz`
- in my `settings.py` file, I added the following to my `INSTALLED_APPS`:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'django_extensions',
    ...
]
```
- back in the terminal: `python3 manage.py graph_models -a -o erd.png`
- dragged the new `erd.png` file into my `documentation/` folder
- removed `'django_extensions',` from my `INSTALLED_APPS`
- finally, in the terminal: `pip3 uninstall django-extensions pygraphviz -y`

## Agile Development Process

### GitHub Projects

[GitHub Projects](https://github.com/ciarangriffin93/KicksOnFire/projects) served as an Agile tool for this project.
It isn't a specialized tool, but with the right tags and project creation/issue assignments, it can be made to work.


### GitHub Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ciarangriffin93/KicksOnFire/issues) served as an another Agile tool.
There, I used my own **User Story Template** to manage user stories.


- [Open Issues](https://github.com/ciarangriffin93/KicksOnFire/issues) [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/ciarangriffin93/KicksOnFire)](https://github.com/ciarangriffin93/KicksOnFire/issues)

    ![screenshot](documentation/gh-issues-open.png)

- [Closed Issues](https://github.com/ciarangriffin93/KicksOnFire/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) [![GitHub closed issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-closed/ciarangriffin93/KicksOnFire)](https://github.com/ciarangriffin93/KicksOnFire/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)

    ![screenshot](documentation/gh-issues-closed.png)

### MoSCoW Prioritization

I've decomposed my Epics into stories prior to prioritizing and implementing them.
Using this approach, I was able to apply the MoSCow prioritization and labels to my user stories within the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: guaranteed to be delivered (*max 60% of stories*)
- **Should Have**: adds significant value, but not vital (*the rest ~20% of stories*)
- **Could Have**: has small impact if left out (*20% of stories*)
- **Won't Have**: not a priority for this iteration

## Ecommerce Business Model

This site sells goods to individual customers, and therefore follows a `Business to Customer` model.
It is of the simplest **B2C** forms, as it focuses on individual transactions, and doesn't need anything
such as monthly/annual subscriptions.

It is still in its early development stages, although it already has a newsletter, and links for social media marketing.

Social media can potentially build a community of users around the business, and boost site visitor numbers,
especially when using larger platforms such a Facebook.

A newsletter list can be used by the business to send regular messages to site users.
For example, what items are on special offer, new items in stock,
updates to business hours, notifications of events, and much more!

## Search Engine Optimization (SEO) & Social Media Marketing

### Keywords

I've identified some appropriate keywords to align with my site, that should help users
when searching online to find my page easily from a search engine.
This included a series of the following keyword types

- Short-tail (head terms) keywords
- Long-tail keywords

I also played around with [Word Tracker](https://www.wordtracker.com) a bit
to check the frequency of some of my site's primary keywords (only until the free trial expired).

### Sitemap

I've used [XML-Sitemaps](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com) to generate a sitemap.xml file.
This was generated using my deployed site URL: https://kicks-on-fire-5b791a86ef14.herokuapp.com

After it finished crawling the entire site, it created a
[sitemap.xml](sitemap.xml) which I've downloaded and included in the repository.

### Robots

I've created the [robots.txt](robots.txt) file at the root-level.
Inside, I've included the default settings:

```
User-agent: *
Disallow:
Sitemap: https://kicks-on-fire-5b791a86ef14.herokuapp.com/sitemap.xml
```

Further links for future implementation:
- [Google search console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
- [Creating and submitting a sitemap](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/sitemaps/build-sitemap)
- [Managing your sitemaps and using sitemaps reports](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7451001)
- [Testing the robots.txt file](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6062598)

### Social Media Marketing

Creating a strong social base (with participation) and linking that to the business site can help drive sales.
Using more popular providers with a wider user base, such as Facebook, typically maximizes site views.

I've created a mockup Facebook business account using the
[Balsamiq template](https://code-institute-org.github.io/5P-Assessments-Handbook/files/Facebook_Mockups.zip)
provided by Code Institute.

## Testing

> [!NOTE]  
> For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment


The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://kicks-on-fire-5b791a86ef14.herokuapp.com).

### PostgreSQL Database

This project uses a [Code Institute PostgreSQL Database](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net).

To obtain my own Postgres Database from Code Institute, I followed these steps:

- Signed-in to the CI LMS using my email address.
- An email was sent to me with my new Postgres Database.

> [!CAUTION]  
> - PostgreSQL databases by Code Institute are only available to CI Students.
> - You must acquire your own PostgreSQL database through some other method
> if you plan to clone/fork this repository.
> - Code Institute students are allowed a maximum of 8 databases.
> - Databases are subject to deletion after 18 months.

### Amazon AWS

This project uses [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) to store media and static files online, due to the fact that Heroku doesn't persist this type of data.

Once you've created an AWS account and logged-in, follow these series of steps to get your project connected.
Make sure you're on the **AWS Management Console** page.

#### S3 Bucket

- Search for **S3**.
- Create a new bucket, give it a name (matching your Heroku app name), and choose the region closest to you.
- Uncheck **Block all public access**, and acknowledge that the bucket will be public (required for it to work on Heroku).
- From **Object Ownership**, make sure to have **ACLs enabled**, and **Bucket owner preferred** selected.
- From the **Properties** tab, turn on static website hosting, and type `index.html` and `error.html` in their respective fields, then click **Save**.
- From the **Permissions** tab, paste in the following CORS configuration:

	```shell
	[
		{
			"AllowedHeaders": [
				"Authorization"
			],
			"AllowedMethods": [
				"GET"
			],
			"AllowedOrigins": [
				"*"
			],
			"ExposeHeaders": []
		}
	]
	```

- Copy your **ARN** string.
- From the **Bucket Policy** tab, select the **Policy Generator** link, and use the following steps:
	- Policy Type: **S3 Bucket Policy**
	- Effect: **Allow**
	- Principal: `*`
	- Actions: **GetObject**
	- Amazon Resource Name (ARN): **paste-your-ARN-here**
	- Click **Add Statement**
	- Click **Generate Policy**
	- Copy the entire Policy, and paste it into the **Bucket Policy Editor**

		```shell
		{
			"Id": "Policy1234567890",
			"Version": "2012-10-17",
			"Statement": [
				{
					"Sid": "Stmt1234567890",
					"Action": [
						"s3:GetObject"
					],
					"Effect": "Allow",
					"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
					"Principal": "*",
				}
			]
		}
		```

	- Before you click "Save", add `/*` to the end of the Resource key in the Bucket Policy Editor (like above).
	- Click **Save**.
- From the **Access Control List (ACL)** section, click "Edit" and enable **List** for **Everyone (public access)**, and accept the warning box.
	- If the edit button is disabled, you need to change the **Object Ownership** section above to **ACLs enabled** (mentioned above).

#### IAM

Back on the AWS Services Menu, search for and open **IAM** (Identity and Access Management).
Once on the IAM page, follow these steps:

- From **User Groups**, click **Create New Group**.
	- Suggested Name: `group-kicksonfire` (group + the project name)
- Tags are optional, but you must click it to get to the **review policy** page.
- From **User Groups**, select your newly created group, and go to the **Permissions** tab.
- Open the **Add Permissions** dropdown, and click **Attach Policies**.
- Select the policy, then click **Add Permissions** at the bottom when finished.
- From the **JSON** tab, select the **Import Managed Policy** link.
	- Search for **S3**, select the `AmazonS3FullAccess` policy, and then **Import**.
	- You'll need your ARN from the S3 Bucket copied again, which is pasted into "Resources" key on the Policy.

		```shell
		{
			"Version": "2012-10-17",
			"Statement": [
				{
					"Effect": "Allow",
					"Action": "s3:*",
					"Resource": [
						"arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name",
						"arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
					]
				}
			]
		}
		```
	
	- Click **Review Policy**.
	- Suggested Name: `policy-kicksonfire` (policy + the project name)
	- Provide a description:
		- "Access to S3 Bucket for kicksonfire static files."
	- Click **Create Policy**.
- From **User Groups**, click your "group-kicksonfire".
- Click **Attach Policy**.
- Search for the policy you've just created ("policy-kicksonfire") and select it, then **Attach Policy**.
- From **User Groups**, click **Add User**.
	- Suggested Name: `user-kicksonfire` (user + the project name)
- For "Select AWS Access Type", select **Programmatic Access**.
- Select the group to add your new user to: `group-kicksonfire`
- Tags are optional, but you must click it to get to the **review user** page.
- Click **Create User** once done.
- You should see a button to **Download .csv**, so click it to save a copy on your system.
	- **IMPORTANT**: once you pass this page, you cannot come back to download it again, so do it immediately!
	- This contains the user's **Access key ID** and **Secret access key**.
	- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` = **Access key ID**
	- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` = **Secret access key**

#### Final AWS Setup

- If Heroku Config Vars has `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` still, this can be removed now, so that AWS will handle the static files.
- Back within **S3**, create a new folder called: `media`.
- Select any existing media images for your project to prepare them for being uploaded into the new folder.
- Under **Manage Public Permissions**, select **Grant public read access to this object(s)**.
- No further settings are required, so click **Upload**.

### Stripe API

This project uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com) to handle the ecommerce payments.

Once you've created a Stripe account and logged-in, follow these series of steps to get your project connected.

- From your Stripe dashboard, click to expand the "Get your test API keys".
- You'll have two keys here:
	- `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` = Publishable Key (starts with **pk**)
	- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` = Secret Key (starts with **sk**)

As a backup, in case users prematurely close the purchase-order page during payment, we can include Stripe Webhooks.

- From your Stripe dashboard, click **Developers**, and select **Webhooks**.
- From there, click **Add Endpoint**.
	- `https://kicks-on-fire-5b791a86ef14.herokuapp.com/checkout/wh/`
- Click **receive all events**.
- Click **Add Endpoint** to complete the process.
- You'll have a new key here:
	- `STRIPE_WH_SECRET` = Signing Secret (Wehbook) Key (starts with **wh**)

### Gmail API

This project uses [Gmail](https://mail.google.com) to handle sending emails to users for account verification and purchase order confirmations.

Once you've created a Gmail (Google) account and logged-in, follow these series of steps to get your project connected.

- Click on the **Account Settings** (cog icon) in the top-right corner of Gmail.
- Click on the **Accounts and Import** tab.
- Within the section called "Change account settings", click on the link for **Other Google Account settings**.
- From this new page, select **Security** on the left.
- Select **2-Step Verification** to turn it on. (verify your password and account)
- Once verified, select **Turn On** for 2FA.
- Navigate back to the **Security** page, and you'll see a new option called **App passwords**.
- This might prompt you once again to confirm your password and account.
- Select **Mail** for the app type.
- Select **Other (Custom name)** for the device type.
	- Any custom name, such as "Django" or KicksOnFire
- You'll be provided with a 16-character password (API key).
	- Save this somewhere locally, as you cannot access this key again later!
	- `EMAIL_HOST_PASS` = user's 16-character API key
	- `EMAIL_HOST_USER` = user's own personal Gmail email address

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | user's own value |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | user's own value |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user's own value |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (*this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment*) |
| `EMAIL_HOST_PASS` | user's own value |
| `EMAIL_HOST_USER` | user's own value |
| `SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |
| `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` | user's own value |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |
| `STRIPE_WH_SECRET` | user's own value |
| `USE_AWS` | True |

Heroku needs three additional files in order to deploy properly.

- requirements.txt
- Procfile
- runtime.txt

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- *replace **app_name** with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located*

The **runtime.txt** file needs to know which Python version you're using:
1. type: `python3 --version` in the terminal.
2. in the **runtime.txt** file, add your Python version:
	- `python-3.9.19`

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_PASS", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_USER", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_WH_SECRET", "user's own value")

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:

- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` or `⌘+C` (Mac)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (if applicable): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (repeat for each file)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

If you'd like to backup your database models, use the following command for each model you'd like to create a fixture for:

- `python3 manage.py dumpdata your-model > your-model.json`
- *repeat this action for each model you wish to backup*

#### Cloning

You can clone the repository by following these steps:

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ciarangriffin93/KicksOnFire) 
2. Locate the Code button above the list of files and click it 
3. Select if you prefer to clone using HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI and click the copy button to copy the URL to your clipboard
4. Open Git Bash or Terminal
5. Change the current working directory to the one where you want the cloned directory
6. In your IDE Terminal, type the following command to clone my repository:
	- `git clone https://github.com/ciarangriffin93/KicksOnFire.git`
7. Press Enter to create your local clone.

Alternatively, if using Gitpod, you can click below to create your own workspace using this repository.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/ciarangriffin93/KicksOnFire)

Please note that in order to directly open the project in Gitpod, you need to have the browser extension installed.
A tutorial on how to do that can be found [here](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension).

#### Forking


By forking the GitHub Repository, we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original owner's repository.
You can fork this repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ciarangriffin93/KicksOnFire)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. Once clicked, you should now have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account!

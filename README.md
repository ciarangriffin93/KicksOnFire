## Introduction

Welcome to KicksOnFire, your online destination for comfortable sneakers! Our modern e-commerce platform offers a curated selection of top-quality sneakers, carefully chosen to meet all your style and performance needs.

In addition to our diverse range of sneakers, we provide convenient features like account creation. By creating an account, you can easily add products to your wishlist and write reviews for your favorite items.

This business idea is close to my heart, as it lets me combine my love of fashion sneakers with my passion for using Django, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python.
